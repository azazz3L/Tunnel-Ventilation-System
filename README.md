## Anand Mincons Web Application
This repository contains the code for the Anand Mincons Web Application. This application is designed for handling and processing various project parameters, input details, and output calculations related to mining construction projects.

## Structure of the Application
The application is built using HTML for the structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for interactivity. It comprises several forms to collect user input regarding the project parameters and input details. The input is then used to calculate various output parameters.

## Features
Project Parameters Form: This is the form where users can input project parameters such as the company name, project name, tunnel name, type of excavation, project number, project date, duct classification, application, person in charge, and customer.

### Input Details Form: 
This form collects various input details that are used in calculation outputs. These include Friction Coefficient, Leakage, Site Height [m], Temperature [degree C], AirVolume at Front [cbm/s], Pressure at Duct End [Pa], Duct Length [m], Duct Diameter [m], Ventilator Efficiency, and Zeta Loss Factor.

### Output Details Form: 
After user fills out the Project Parameters and Input Details forms and presses the "Calculate" button, the application calculates the output parameters such as Air Density [kgm-3], L/D Factor, Pressure Factor a1, Loss Factor e1, Ventilator Volume Supply [cbm/s], Stat. Pressure Loss [Pa], Dyn. Pressure Loss [Pa], Addit. Losses [Pa], Total Pressure Loss [Pa], and Minimum Inst. Capacity [kW].

### Buttons: 
The application includes three buttons: "Calculate", "Save", and "Generate". The "Calculate" button is used to calculate the output based on the given input details. The "Save" button is used to save the current state of the form, and the "Generate" button is used to generate the result based on the output calculations.

### Logout: 
There's also a logout button for user to end the session.
